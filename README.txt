A thing I did because I'm immature and was bored. :3
the cipher is based around E621, and a good way to think of the pattern is with two rows of alphabets:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

the first row acts as a bank, while the second is what you are translating from.

Starting at E in the bank, you go over 6, and that letter coresponds with E in the second row like so:

A B C D E F G H I J - L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
- - - - K - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Then, from that K, you'd go over 2 to M, then 1 to N:

A B C D E F G H I J - L - - O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
- - - - K M N - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Repeat and loop until all leters from the bank are used:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
I J H P K M N T V W C E F O Q R A D G S X Y L U Z B
